- **Dependency Issues**: Parallel development where possible
- **Testing Delays**: Automated testing from early stages

## Check-in Points

### Weekly Check-ins
- **Week 1**: Foundation completion and basic API
- **Week 2**: GLSL validation working
- **Week 3**: ISF integration complete
- **Week 4**: Advanced features implemented
- **Week 5**: Testing and deployment ready

### Milestone Deliverables
- **Milestone 1**: Basic validation API (Step 7)
- **Milestone 2**: ISF support (Step 11)
- **Milestone 3**: Complete system (Step 20)
- **Milestone 4**: Production ready (Step 25)

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building the complete AI shader validation tool, with each step being self-contained and deliverable independently.
