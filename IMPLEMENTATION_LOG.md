# AI Shader Validation Tool - Implementation Log

This log documents the implementation process, summarizing user prompts, requirements, deviations from the plan, and what was implemented at each step.

---

## Pre-Step Work: Requirements, Architecture, and Planning

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested a requirements document for an AI shader validation tool supporting GLSL, ISF, MadMapper, and other shader variants, with AI validation, analysis, and self-correction capabilities, including visual analysis.
- Assistant generated comprehensive requirements, project structure, and technical architecture documents.
- User requested updates to target single-developer deployment using Docker Compose, SQLite, and local storage. Assistant updated requirements and architecture accordingly.
- User asked to evaluate VVISF-GL for ISF shader execution. Assistant confirmed its maturity and updated the architecture to integrate VVISF-GL via C++ bindings (pybind11), updating all relevant docs and scripts.
- User requested a detailed implementation plan with self-contained steps.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- None (all planning and documentation steps were completed as requested).

**What Was Implemented:**
- Requirements, project structure, architecture, deployment, and implementation plan documents were created and iteratively updated per user feedback.

## Step 1: Project Foundation & Docker Setup

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested to start with Step 1 of the implementation plan.
- User later requested that after every step, an implementation log should be updated summarizing user prompts and deviations.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- Encountered issues with the Dockerfile copying a non-existent config/ directory; resolved by removing the COPY command for config/.
- The requirements.txt file initially included sqlite3 (not pip-installable) and pyglsl-parser (not available on PyPI); both were removed or commented with TODOs.

**What Was Implemented:**
- Created the full project directory structure as defined in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md.
- Added all necessary __init__.py files for Python packages.
- Set up Docker Compose and Dockerfile for development.
- Created and fixed requirements.txt for all core dependencies.
- Created a comprehensive .gitignore.
- Scaffolded src/api/main.py with a working FastAPI app and health check endpoint.
- Added configuration and logging scaffolding (src/config/settings.py, src/config/logging.py, and environment configs).
- Verified that the Docker container builds and runs, and the health check endpoint responds as expected.

---

## Step 2: Core API Framework

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested to proceed with Step 2 of the implementation plan.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- FastAPI middleware classes (logging and rate limiting) needed to be implemented as ASGI-compatible classes with __init__(app) and __call__ methods, not as callables with (request, call_next). Fixed both middleware accordingly.
- Added PyJWT to requirements for authentication middleware (not originally listed).
- Fixed a duplicate field name in the VisualizationRequest model.
- Added a /api/v1/config endpoint for configuration inspection.

**What Was Implemented:**
- Created authentication, rate limiting, and logging middleware (ASGI-compatible).
- Created Pydantic request and response models for validation, analysis, visualization, and ISF endpoints.
- Created error models and exception handlers for robust error handling.
- Updated the main FastAPI app to include all middleware, exception handlers, and enhanced configuration management.
- Rebuilt and tested the Docker container; verified the health endpoint works and the app starts with all middleware and error handling in place.

## Step 3: Database Layer & Models

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested to proceed with Step 3 of the implementation plan.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- Alembic was not available in the local environment, so migration setup was noted for Docker/container use.
- The database health check required SQLAlchemy's text() for raw SQL execution.
- The database initialization script had to be run as a module (python -m src.database.init) in Docker due to import paths.

**What Was Implemented:**
- Created SQLAlchemy models for shaders, validation_results, analysis_results, and generated_images.
- Implemented database connection management with sessionmaker and scoped_session.
- Added a database initialization script to create all tables.
- Added a health check endpoint for database connectivity and integrated it into the API.
- Verified database health and initialization in the running Docker container.

## Step 4: Core Validation Engine Framework

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested to proceed with Step 4 of the implementation plan.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- None; the step was implemented as planned with clear separation of parser interface, validation engine, analysis pipeline, and error aggregation utilities.

**What Was Implemented:**
- Created a base parser interface (BaseShaderParser) for all shader formats.
- Implemented the core ValidationEngine with plugin architecture for registering and using different shader parsers.
- Scaffolded the analysis pipeline framework for running analyzers.
- Added basic error aggregation utilities for validation results.
- Created a validation service to orchestrate validation requests using the engine.

---

## Step 5: GLSL Parser Implementation

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested to proceed with Step 5 of the implementation plan.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- The GLSL AST dataclass implementation had field ordering issues that would need to be resolved in a full implementation.
- The Lark parser grammar was simplified for demonstration purposes; a full implementation would need more comprehensive GLSL grammar rules.
- Line and column tracking in error reporting was simplified (using line 1, column 1) due to the scope of this step.

**What Was Implemented:**
- Created a GLSL lexer using Lark with a basic GLSL grammar.
- Implemented GLSL AST representation with dataclasses for various GLSL constructs.
- Created a GLSL parser implementing the BaseShaderParser interface with syntax and semantic validation.
- Added syntax analyzer for checking braces, semicolons, parentheses, and comments.
- Added semantic analyzer for checking undefined variables/functions, type compatibility, and built-in variable usage.
- Registered the GLSL parser with the validation engine.
- Implemented basic error reporting and metadata extraction (uniforms, attributes, varyings, functions).

## Step 6: Basic Validation Logic

**User Prompts:**
- Request to proceed to Step 6: Basic Validation Logic

**Deviations from Plan:**
- Enhanced logic flow analysis with comprehensive data flow tracking

## Step 7: Validation API Endpoints

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested to proceed with Step 7: Validation API Endpoints from the implementation plan.
- Requirements: Implement API endpoints for shader validation, batch validation, validation history, and validation status. Ensure proper request/response models, error handling, and result storage.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- Several fixes were required for dataclass field ordering in the GLSL AST to resolve runtime errors.
- The GLSLParser was being instantiated incorrectly in the validation service; fixed to instantiate with code as needed.
- Analyzer result handling was generalized to support placeholder and real analyzers.
- The GLFeature enum was missing TEXTURE_BUFFERS, which was added to resolve an AttributeError.
- The database models did not include ValidationRecord and ValidationHistory, which were added to support the API endpoints.
- Adjusted the batch validation and error handling logic to work with the new models and analyzers.

**Implementation Details:**
- Created/updated request and response models for validation, batch validation, history, and status endpoints in `src/api/models/requests.py` and `src/api/models/responses.py`.
- Implemented the validation API routes in `src/api/routes/validation.py` for:
  - POST `/api/v1/validate` (single shader validation)
  - POST `/api/v1/validate/batch` (batch validation)
  - GET `/api/v1/validate/history` (validation history)
  - GET `/api/v1/validate/status/{validation_id}` (validation status)
  - GET `/api/v1/validate/summary` (validation summary)
- Integrated the validation routes into the main FastAPI app in `src/api/main.py`.
- Fixed dataclass field ordering in `src/core/parser/glsl_ast.py`.

- Added missing GLFeature enum values in `src/core/utils/gl_utils.py`.
- Added `ValidationRecord` and `ValidationHistory` models to `src/database/models.py`.
- Rebuilt and tested the Docker container after each major fix.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Dataclass field ordering errors in the AST required reordering and flattening of base/child fields.
- GLSLParser instantiation required code parameter; fixed in validation service.
- Analyzer result handling needed to be generalized for placeholder and real analyzers.
- AttributeError for missing GLFeature.TEXTURE_BUFFERS; fixed by adding the enum value.
- ImportError for missing ValidationRecord; fixed by adding the model to the database layer.
- Required several Docker rebuilds to ensure all changes were picked up and runtime errors resolved.
