# AI Shader Validation Tool - Implementation Log

This log documents the implementation process, summarizing user prompts, requirements, deviations from the plan, and what was implemented at each step.

---

## Pre-Step Work: Requirements, Architecture, and Planning

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested a requirements document for an AI shader validation tool supporting GLSL, ISF, MadMapper, and other shader variants, with AI validation, analysis, and self-correction capabilities, including visual analysis.
- Assistant generated comprehensive requirements, project structure, and technical architecture documents.
- User requested updates to target single-developer deployment using Docker Compose, SQLite, and local storage. Assistant updated requirements and architecture accordingly.
- User asked to evaluate VVISF-GL for ISF shader execution. Assistant confirmed its maturity and updated the architecture to integrate VVISF-GL via C++ bindings (pybind11), updating all relevant docs and scripts.
- User requested a detailed implementation plan with self-contained steps.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- None (all planning and documentation steps were completed as requested).

**What Was Implemented:**
- Requirements, project structure, architecture, deployment, and implementation plan documents were created and iteratively updated per user feedback.

## Step 1: Project Foundation & Docker Setup

**User Prompts & Requirements:**
- User requested to start with Step 1 of the implementation plan.
- User later requested that after every step, an implementation log should be updated summarizing user prompts and deviations.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- Encountered issues with the Dockerfile copying a non-existent config/ directory; resolved by removing the COPY command for config/.
- The requirements.txt file initially included sqlite3 (not pip-installable) and pyglsl-parser (not available on PyPI); both were removed or commented with TODOs.

**What Was Implemented:**
- Created the full project directory structure as defined in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md.
- Added all necessary __init__.py files for Python packages.
- Set up Docker Compose and Dockerfile for development.
- Created and fixed requirements.txt for all core dependencies.
- Created a comprehensive .gitignore.
- Scaffolded src/api/main.py with a working FastAPI app and health check endpoint.
- Added configuration and logging scaffolding (src/config/settings.py, src/config/logging.py, and environment configs).
- Verified that the Docker container builds and runs, and the health check endpoint responds as expected.
